## Overview

C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs. It was designed to provide object-oriented capabilities with the efficiency and flexibility of C. Over the years, C++ has evolved and become one of the most widely used programming languages, particularly in systems programming, game development, and real-time simulations.

## Features of C++

### Object-Oriented Programming

C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP) which allows developers to create objects that encapsulate data and functions together. This promotes code reuse and modularity. Key concepts of OOP in C++ include classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### Standard Template Library (STL)

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful feature of C++ that provides a collection of template classes and functions for common data structures and algorithms. STL includes features such as vectors, lists, queues, stacks, and various sorting and searching algorithms.

### Memory Management

C++ provides fine-grained control over memory management. It supports dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory using operators like `new` and `delete`. This level of control is crucial for system-level programming where performance and resource management are critical.

### Performance

C++ is known for its high performance and close-to-hardware capabilities. It allows developers to write code that is efficient and fast, making it ideal for performance-critical applications such as game development, real-time simulations, and embedded systems.

## Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Print Hello, World!
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
